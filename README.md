# CPSC552_GroupProject

This is the Spring 2023 CPSC552 Deep Learning Theory and Applications Group Project by Eva Gao, Yiheng Zhou, and Qiuyu (Olina) Zhu.

## Project Report 
The "Paired GAN Image Mask Generation for Medical Image Segmentation.pdf" file is the final project report for our group. It includes both the report in NeurIPS format, as well as sections for literature citations and figures. 

## Project Code 
The "VessGAN.ipynb" file is the code script for the VessGAN run on the main dataset, retinal image/masks from DRIVE: Grand Challenge [1]. The VessGAN architecture was adapted from Goodfellow et al., 2014 [3]. 

The "VessGAN_CT.ipynb" file is the code script for the VessGAN run on the generalization testing dataset, COVID-19 Chest CT image/masks from MedSeg COVID-19 [2]. The Vess2Image architecture was adapted from Isola et al., 2018 [4]. 

The "Vess2Image.ipynb" file is the code script for the Vess2Image run on the main dataset, retinal image/masks from DRIVE: Grand Challenge [1].
